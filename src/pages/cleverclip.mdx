# Reasons I Should Get Hired for Full Stack Developer at Cleverclip

---

<IntroCard company={`Cleverclip`} />

---

## Tech

- JavaScript / React is my bread and butter. Python was my first language and I'm excited for a reason to get back into it

- I make pixel perfect things âœ¨

- I like data modeling. My personal project [untrip.app](untrip.app) uses [prisma](https://v1.prisma.io/docs/1.34/prisma-client/), which sits on top of an SQL database and lets me talk to it in JavaScript

- I thrive on taking abstract concepts / ideas and implementing them in code + user interfaces

## Other

- I think in lists ðŸ¤“

- I once wrote a MA thesis on popular children's bedtime animation series in Central Eastern Europe during times of socialism

- I've been working 100% remote since May 2018. I know it's how I produce my best work

- One of my personal mantras is the [jack of one trade is the connector of none](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/476431511206764544?s=20)
