# Reasons I Should Get Hired for Full-Stack Software Engineer at Farmstead

---

<IntroCard company={`Farmstead`} />

---

## Tech

- React is my bread and butter 🍞🧈. This list is written in MDX, a combination of React components and markdown

- I make pixel perfect things

- I deployed the GraphQL server + database for [untrip.app](https://untrip.app) on Heroku (free tier now so may take time to "wake up")

- My best friends and neighbors are software engineers. Rails and PostgreSQL are both in their work tech stack. I rubber duck with them locally

## Other

- I think in lists 🤓

- I'm an avid home chef who has thought about starting a delivery only restaurant

- I'm currently experiencing the problem that farmfresh is solving

- Another project I want to do smartly recommends the dishes I like to make so I can automate that decision

- I've been working 100% remote since May 2018. I know that's how I work my best, in solo mode
