# Reasons I Should Get Hired for Full-Stack Software Engineer at Farmstead

---

<IntroCard company={`Farmstead`} />

## Tech

- JavaScript + React is my bread and butter. This page is written in <a href="https://mdxjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDX</a>, a combination of React components (JSX) and markdown

- I make pixel perfect things

- I deployed the GraphQL server + database for [untrip.app](https://untrip.app), a personal project, on Heroku (free tier now so may take time to wake up)

- My best friends / neighbors are remote-first software engineers. Rails and PostgreSQL are in their work tech stack. I "rubber duck" with them

## Other

- I think in lists ðŸ¤“

- I'm personally experiencing the problem that Farmstead is solving. I'm fired up about the concept

- I'm an avid home chef who has thought about starting delivery-only restaurants

- A project I want to do smartly recommends the dishes I like to make so I can automate that decision

- I've been working 100% remote since May 2018. I know it's how I produce my best work.
