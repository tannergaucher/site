## Tech

1. Modern JavaScript, React, and Node.js is my 🍞 and 🧈. This is a Gatsby.js site and this page is written in [MDX,](https://mdxjs.) a mix of markdown and React components

```jsx
// 3. I'm up on the latest ES6 features

const { destructuring } = myFavoriteFeature

5. I've spent years living in Airbnbs. I've faced problems that Feather solves

6. I think in ordered lists 🤓
