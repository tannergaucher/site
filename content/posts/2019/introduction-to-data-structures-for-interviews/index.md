## On Application Versus Implementation

- Be able to implement them, but more importantly, be able to apply the correct ones to solve problems / interview questions

## How to Prepare Effectively

- Don't just memorize
- Find themes but don't jump to conclusions
- Practice with a timer. Being able to solve things quickly matters
- Actually practice. Reading doesn't count

## Stacks and Queues

- Ordered data structures that have opinions about how things can be inserted and removed

### Stack

- Last in, first out
- Push and pop methods

### Queue

- First in, first out
- Enqueue and dequeue methods

### Pros

- Fast operations

### Implementation of a Stack

```js
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this._storage = {}
    this._length = 0
  }

  push(value) {
    this._storage[this._length] = value
    this.length++
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.length) {
      const lastValue = this._storage[this._length - 1]
      delete this._storage[lastValue]
      this._length--

      return lastValue
    }
  }

  peek() {
    if (this._length) {
      return this._storage[this._length - 1]
    }
  }
}
```

### Implementation of a Queue

```js
class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this._storage = {}
    this._length = 0
    this._headIndex = 0
  }

  // Enqueues a new value at the end of the queue.
  enqueue(value) {
    const lastIndex = this._length + this._headIndex
    this._storage[lastIndex] = value
    this._length++
  }

  // Dequeues the value from the beginning of the queue and returns it.
  dequeue() {
    if (this._length) {
      const firstValue = this._storage[this._headIndex]
      delete this._storage[this._headIndex]
      this._length--
      this._headIndex++

      return firstValue
    }
  }

  // Returns the value from the beginning of the queue without deleting it.
  peek() {
    return this._storage[this._headIndex]
  }
}
```

## Linked Lists

- Organize items sequentially, with each item storing a pointer to the next
- JS has dynamic arrays, more important in languages that don't have dynamic arrays
- Each item has a property next that points to another object
- Linked lists are often the underlying data structure for a stack or a queue

> ### What Is a Reference?
>
> When we assign values to an object, we are really just pointing to that object. The object doesn't live inside the variable, the variable is just a pointer to the object in memory. If we assign another variable to that object, we have 2 variables pointing to the same object. But there's only one object. That's what we mean by reference. Pointers point to nodes (objects).

### Pros

- Fast operations on the ends
- Flexible size
- Can do constant time insertions anywhere in the list
- Quick deletions from the middle (when deleting from middle of array, then must shift everything after that index over by one)

### Cons

- Costly lookups (when searching. If you have a reference to a node that you want to delete, then it's constant)

### Naive Linked List Example

```js
const linkedList = {
  head: {
    value: 1,
    next: {
      value: 2,
      next: {
        value: 3,
        next: null,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

- This example has no reference to previous. If it did, it would be a _doubly linked list_
- Hash tables often use linked lists under the hood

> ### Common Use Case for a Linked List
>
> A Least recently used cache, which keeps track of new searches. As we get new input, we take things out. A least recently used cache would remove the least recently searched term.

### Linked List Implementation

```js
class LinkedList {
  constructor(value) {
    this.head = { value, next: null }
    this.tail = this.head
  }

  // Inserts a new value to the end of the linked list.
  insert(value) {
    const node = { value, next: null }
    // Set the next value of the current tail to our new node
    this.tail.next = node
    // Update the tail to be the real tail, which is the new node.
    this.tail = node
  }

  // Deletes a node, given a reference to a node.
  remove() {}

  // Removes the value at the end of the linked list.
  removeTail() {
    // Loop through and get to the node right before the tail.
    // THIS IS HOW TO TRAVERSE A LINKED LIST.
    let currentNode = this.head
    while (currentNode.next !== this.tail) {
      currentNode = currentNode.next
    }

    currentNode.next = null
    this.tail = currentNode
  }

  isHead(node) {
    return node === this.head
  }

  isTail(node) {
    return node === this.tail
  }

  // Searches linked list and returns true of it contains the value passed.
  contains(value) {
    let currentNode = this.head
    while (currentNode.value !== value) {
      currentNode = currentNode.next
    }

    return currentNode.value === value
  }
}
```

## Hash Tables

- Are not ordered, don't get sorted
- Organize data for quick lookup of a value for a given key
- For hash tables, we think about the average case, rather than worst case, because chance of worst case happening is slim
- When thinking about optimizing a problem that requires a fast lookup, we should always think hash table
- Be able to choose appropriate data structure when implementing
  - Object
  - Map
  - Set

### Pros

- Quick lookups (constant time)
- Quick insertions (constant time)
- Keys are flexible (array indexes are numerically constrained)
- Keys can be strings
- With ES6, keys can be functions too if using set or map
- In JS, object, set, map are hash table data structures

### Cons

- Slow worst case lookups
- Unordered
- Single directional lookups

### Hash Table Main Concepts

- Hashing function
- Collisions
- Resizing

### Hashing Function

- Takes key and hashes it
- For every input, always gives the same output

### Resizing

- Hashing functions return a value within a certain range.
- Have to specify this when implementing a hash table
- Once range becomes full, need to make it bigger
- Typically, once hash table becomes 50% full, then you double it (mathematically found to be most efficient, more collisions happen when more than half full)
- After doubling range, you redistribute by rehashing all existing values to the newly doubled range
- Implement this with same hash function, which has a range parameter, and double that value

### Collisions

- When you get the same hash value for multiple keys. So one hash value has multiple contents
- Having many collisions can affect run time for a lookup

### Hash Table Implementation

```js
class HashTable {
  constructor(val) {
    this._storage = []
    this._tableSize = val
  }

  // Inserts a new key-value pair in constant time.
  insert(key, value) {
    const index = this._hash(key, this._tableSize)

    // Handle collisions.
    if (!this._storage[index]) {
      this._storage[index] = []
    }
    this._storage[index].push([key, value])
  }

  // Deletes a key-value pair in constant time.
  remove(key) {
    const index = this._hash(key, this._tableSize)
    let arrayAtIndex = this._storage[index]

    if (arrayAtIndex) {
      for (let i = 0; i < arrayAtIndex.length; i++) {
        const keyValueArray = arrayAtIndex[i]

        if (keyValueArray[0] === key) {
          arrayAtIndex = arrayAtIndex.splice(i, 1)
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Returns a value associated with a key in constant time.
  retrieve(key) {
    const index = this._hash(key, this._tableSize)
    const arrayAtIndex = this._storage[index]

    if (arrayAtIndex) {
      for (let i = 0; i < arrayAtIndex.length; i++) {
        const keyValueArray = arrayAtIndex[i]

        if (keyValueArray[0] === key) {
          return keyValueArray[1]
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Hashes a string value into an integer that can be mapped to an array index.
  _hash(str, n) {
    let sum = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
      sum += str.charCodeAt(i)
    }
    return sum % n
  }
}
```

## Arrays and Strings

- Arrays organize items sequentially in memory
- Strings can be thought of as arrays of characters

### Pros

- Fast lookups
- Fast appends

### Cons

- Slow inserts
- Slow deletes (because when inserting / deleting from the middle, must shift everything over)

> ### Strings and Space Complexity
>
> Strings are not mutable. If you change a string, you're really copying to a new string with that change. This has space complexity implications. If you're trying to do something in constant space, you can't use a strings. When working with strings, it's often better to split into array and manipulate using array methods.
