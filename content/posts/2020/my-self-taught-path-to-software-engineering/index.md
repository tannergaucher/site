This is a post about how I went from having no technical background, to believing that I could become a software engineer, to believing that I could
teach myself the field, to doing it over the course of two-plus years.

## The Beginning of Code

In 2016, while living and working in South Korea, I started using bitcoin as a lower friction way to move money around across borders. Like most people, I had heard of it's existance by that point, but had yet to be struck yet by that lightning "aha" moment that some eventually get hit with. I stumbled upon it as a tool to solve a problem I was facing and I fell down the rabbit hole.

I realized that in order to confidently understand it, to use it, I had to understand the technology, from at least a high level, myself. I had a good amount of freetime and fast internet at this point, living in the Korean countryside, and I started falling down the rabbit hole. I listened to all the podcasts I could find, I started watching niche youtube channels and livestreams. I listened to things that didn't make any sense at all until they started making sense. I wrote a Solidity smart contract for an ERC-20 token called tannercoin and sent 4,999 to my friend just for fun.

While reading the introduction to "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopolous, I came across a line in the introduction that at least to my mind said something to the nature of "you can read the introduction and first chapter, but everything after that is intended for software engineers."

Rather than considering that the end of my rabbit hole, I considered it challenge accepted. I had to learn at least how to read the code examples in the book.

## Learning What Programming Is

To this point, the concept of code served as a sort of shorthand for "secret stuff that I don't understand".
Not having a technical background, I just assumed that it was something I couldn't, and wouldn't, be able to do.

What is code? What is software? What is a program? As someone without previous knowledge in this domain, the answers were not obvious. Don't tell yourself you can't do something if you don't even know what that thing is.

After a bit of googling, I came across multiple recommendations for a book called "Learn Python the Hard Way", by Zed Shaw. I bought the PDF and accompanying videos, downloaded a text editor, and opened up my terminal.

The style of the book, through controversial, is basically to just type out the programs for each chapter. Try to understand it as you type, but keep going if you don't. Type it out and make it run.

I still remember working through chapter one, getting the program to run, and seeing the output of the program in my text editor. It clicked. That's was a program is. That's what code is. That's what computing is. Input and output. A fixed amount of basic concepts layered on top of eachother ad infinitum.

## Learning What Programming Is Problem Solving Means

There is more to making software than typing something out and making it run. As I continued to google around, I keep seeing the advice that fundementally, programming is problem solving. While it sounds self-explanitory but I didn't understand what that means just yet, because I hadn't put myself in a position to start running into problems yet.

Freecodecamp taught me what the concept "programming is problem solving" means.

Do an exercise, get stuck, look something up in the documantion, make it work. Repeat. There's a lot to look up, there's always something new to get stuck on, but the process is always the same, and it never ends. So learn that early and get used to it.

## On Not Going to Coding Bootcamp

Once I intuited what programming is problem solving is, I was hooked. It wasn't easy, but after banging my head on a problem, I could always figure it out eventually. It was clear that all the information was out there, online, one well-phrased google search away.

Living in the days of coding bootcamps, it almost seems a given that a successful pivot into tech happens after attending a bootcamp.

They are expensive, but they sell the possiblity graduating into a potentially great gig. Obviously, not everyone lands their dream gig, they don't hold your hand directly into an open position, but there are great success stories.

I began to think that rather than attending a bootcamp, that path I was already on seemed like it was working quite well. I was learning a ton, I was progrssing fast. I had the idea of why start paying someone else money to do what I'm already doing myself?

## Making My Own Bootcamp

It became clear that I wanted to continue on this self-taught path rather than attending a bootcamp. I was also in the very fortunate position, after saving approximately 70% of my Korean income two years that I had the financial means / freedom to attend a bootcamp, if I chose to.

While thinking about all the costs, from tuition to living in NYC / San Franciso for 3 months, I compared that to the cost of living I knew from my travels in Southeast Asia. If I wanted to, I could take the cost of a coding bootcamp and apply that towards funding my own "DIY Remote" bootcamp.

I could live and work remotely in Southeast Asia while teaching continuing to self-study. There's no better investment you can make than investing in yourself, your skills.

I found some amazing looking coworking spaces. In the monkey forest of Ubud, Bali. On the remote tropical island of

I could work as much as I want to, and whenever I was burnt out, I could head to the beach. I could listen to "Software Engineering Daily" as I got my evening excersice on the beach.

## Overcoming The Downsides of a Self-Learning Path

### Working in a silo

### Imposter syndrome is real

### Moving Goalposts

Set a date. By X day I will start applying for jobs, no matter what.
