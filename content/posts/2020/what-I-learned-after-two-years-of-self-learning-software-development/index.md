## Set Goals of Concreate, Measurable, Output

- Time fills all given space for learning. Can't just learn until you're ready.
- Measure your day by setting measurable tasks and working through them.
- Don't say X, say Y

## Maintain Balance Between Active and Passive Learning

- Finding the right balance of learning by doing, not getting stuck in dead-ends but not giving up too early can be difficut.
- Don't just learn by doing. And dont just do by learning.
- Schedule out concrete materials - videos, tutorials - into your calendar ahead of time

## Be What You Are Becoming

<!--

At some point, you're not trying to become X. You are X. So do what X does.
Make a schedule and stick to it. But always tinker with it and adjust.

Watch conference videos while you're eating lunch. Figure out your most productive times of the day and utilize them.

## Focus on Process: Iterate, Iterate, Iterate

Software as craft. Software as an art.

I leave behind me a wake of hundreds of unfinished projects, and I think it's a good thing. I approached learning this field as if it's a craft. You don't start writing songs and expecting them to be any good. You have to get the hundreds of bad ones out. Ira Glass's concept of "the gap"

And so I would start projects, and give up. Start a new project combining what I previously learned and what was new at the moment. Give that up too.
I figured that if I looked back on something and didn't like it, that was a good thing. It means I know more now than I did then. It means I'm going in the right direction.

Never measure yourself against others. Wake up and measure yourself against who you were yesterday.

### Participate in Community

Freecodecamp forum. Developer twitter. Youtube channels and podcasts. There's a bunch of ways to start participating in the virtual tech community. Just jump in and get started.

## Learn in Public

Something I regret not doing more of. Leverage your time spent learning by putting it out into the world. It doesn't matter if it is in no interest to anyone at all. It will probably be on interest to you later. And if it is of interest to you, there's a good chance it will be interesting to someone else.

Don't embassed about past you not knowing something that present you knows. Be pround of that. It means you've progressed.

## Participate in Community

- It can be lonely. Easy to feel stuck inside your own silo. Share what you are up to.

## Design your own Systems

- Hone your work flow. Experiment. Spend time refining your tooling.

- Even (especially) if you're working on a project yourself, be systems driven.

- Identify problems in your flow and use your skills to build tools that solve problems that you face.

## Follow External Curriculum

- Having the freedom to persue your own path means you are responsible for what you are focused on. Have to constantly ask am I focusing on the right thing.
- Follow a big picture path that isn't internal
- I used the general flow of freecodecamp as my guide for when to start learning each piece of the stack
